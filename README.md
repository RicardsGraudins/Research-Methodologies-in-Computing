# Research Methodologies in Computing & IT
This repository contains a professional literature review for my fourth-year (hons) undergraduate project for the module **Research Methodologies in Computing.**
The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie/) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics for the course [B.S.c. (Hons) in Software Developement.](https://www.gmit.ie/software-development/bachelor-science-honours-software-development)
The lecturer is Martin Kenirons.

## Project Guidelines:
> * You are required to produce a professional literature review – a written document – relevant to your chosen research area.
> * Your literature review should be of the order of 2,000 (minimum) to 3,000 (maximum) words (not including bibliography / references section).
> * Your literature review should include at least eight credible, peer-reviewed sources (journals, conferences etc….). A higher count than ten is strongly encouraged.
> * The document must follow a set structure / template.
> * The literature review should follow the IEEE format.

## Project Overview:
The chosen topic for this literature review was Artificial Intelligence in order to get a headstart on the upcoming Artificial Intelligence module in the following semester. Upon completion I chose Machine Learning as the topic for my research presentation since both of these topics are closely related and a true AI requires some form of machine learning. The presentation was held on the 30th of November 2017 in GMIT. 

**Abstract**---*In recent years technology has taken a giant step foward and what was once considered fiction is now becoming reality, but before we can thrive in a futuristic, AI-centered era we must examine the progress AI has made thus far. In this study we cover the technological advancements of artificial intelligence spanning over the past 50 years in two distinct fields - autonomous cars and medicine. We also investigate the origin of artificial intelligence and take a closer look at the components it encompasses. With the rise of machines people are becoming more concerned and uncertain of the future and thus we have researched the risks of creating various AI systems including artificial general intelligence(AGI) and these risks are discussed throughout several sections of this paper.*
